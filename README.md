# Why-
#   With this function I used some code from the declaration code used in the past, I made it so when the word was searched for in the file it would seperate the file into lines then seperate those lines into words without their punctuatuin, then it would loop through a for loop checking if the uppercase word currently defined as i was in the upper case word being searched, it then searches if the upper case word being searched for was present in the upper case value of i and if it infact was then I would increase a counter by one.
